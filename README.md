**Project Proposal
**Schaefer Shaughnessy, Greg Behnke, Michael Sorensen, Junaid Dawood
**Overview**
Predicting pitching stats/outcomes for hypothetical pitching prospects, based on a model generated with Statcast data between 2015-2021. Using pitch selection, pitch location, spin rates break heights, etc. predict pitching outcomes strikeout rates, contact type, swing/miss rate, etc.
Data set: https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/custom?year=2021,2020,2019,2018,2017&type=pitcher&filter=&sort=0&sortDir=desc&min=50&selections=player_age,xba,xslg,xwoba,xobp,xiso,exit_velocity_avg,launch_angle_avg,barrel_batted_rate,z_swing_percent,z_swing_miss_percent,oz_swing_percent,&chart=false&x=xba&y=xba&r=no&chartType=beeswarm
**UI/Application
**Create “prospect builder” – Have user input stats for a hypothetical pitcher and generate predicted pitching outcome percentages. We will likely use a Bootstrap framework and visualize pitching outcomes with Plotly.js.
