                        The official strike zone is the area over home plate from the midpoint between a batter's shoulders and the top of the uniform pants -- when the batter is in his stance and prepared to swing at a pitched ball -- and a point just below the kneecap. In
                        order to get a strike call, part of the ball must cross over part of home plate while in the aforementioned area. Strikes and balls are called by the home-plate umpire after every pitch has passed the batter, unless the batter
                        makes contact with the baseball (in which case the pitch is automatically a strike).

                        A fastball is the most frequent type of pitch thrown by a pitcher. The fastball is generally the highest velocity pitch in the game-it typically ranges in speed from the mid-80s to over 100 mph. The metric is a culculation of the number of fastballs thrown
                        divided by total pitches.

                        A breaking ball (aka breaking pitch) is a pitch in which the pitcher snaps or breaks his wrist to give the ball spin and movement. This includes the curveball, slider, and slurve, but not the various kinds of fastball and change-up or trick pitches like
                        the knuckleball. The metric is a culculation of the number of breaking balls thrown divided by total pitches.

                        an off-speed pitch is a type of pitch thrown in baseball which has a speed and velocity less than that of a fastball. The idea behind this type of pitch is to alter and confuse the timing of the batter. The metric is a culculation of the number of off-speed
                        pitches thrown divided by total pitches

                        A meatball is "an easy pitch to hit, thrown right down the middle of the plate”. The metric is a culculation of the number meatball pitches thrown divided by total pitches.
